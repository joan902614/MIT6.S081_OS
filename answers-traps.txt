Q. ```unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	    printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);```
  What is the output?  
  The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

   0x726c6400
   no change
