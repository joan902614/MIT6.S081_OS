Q.
Why are there missing keys with 2 threads, but not with 1 thread? Identify a sequence of events with 2 threads that can lead to a key being missing.
A.
when hash value the same, two different key will create a node and pointer to table[i] and then store in table[i]. However, the table[i] only can store one of them.
